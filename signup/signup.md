This page describes how you can get access to the FSS API. 
---

## Get access to the Developer Portal
You have to register yourself at the Developer Portal to get access to the API catalogue which contains the FSS API. We provide you two environments. Use our Integration environment to test the API. Production is as the name implies for productive use.

| Environment  | Link                                                                                  |
|:-------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Integration  | [Developer Portal Int](https://proddevportalapimgmtpr-fjhv5cfg85.hana.ondemand.com/)  |
| Production   | [Developer Portal Prod](https://proddevportalapimgmtpr-yhg69aqpq2.hana.ondemand.com/) |

Developers which have a SBB e-mail account can register directly on the Developer Portal. Please provide your e-mail address as user ID and enter your first name, last name, e-mail address and your location. As soon as your registration has been approved you will be granted access to our API catalogue.

If you do not have a SBB account please send an e-mail to [xxxyyyzzz@sbb.ch](mailto:xxxyyyzzz@sbb.ch) and ask for access. Please provide your e-mail address which you want to use for registration and the Developer environment which you want to use. Additionally you also have to provide your first name, last name and your location. After verification we will setup your access to the portal and register you as a developer. 

## Subscribe to the API
Go to the product "SBB Financial System & Services". It contains a "Subscribe" button which which allows you to register yourself as a user of the API. This creates a so called application that provides you an Application Key. Use this key to authenticate your API calls.
